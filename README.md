# Topic: Using React Native and Expo to Creact a Mobile Application <br>

## What is React Native (RN)? <br>

#### 1. Introduction <br>
  RN is a derivative of React for native mobile application platforms and an open-source UI software framework. Based on JavaScript mobile framework, RN can be used to develop applications for iOS and Android platforms. Additionally, RN allows us to write only one codebase that can be applied to both iOS and Android.<br>
  Some advantages of using RN:  
  i) Easy  
  ii) Reusable components  
  iii) One-way data binding, easy to debug large-scale applications.
